You must copy the webphone.jar in this directory first, then edit the webphone.htm file (add at least your SIP server address)

Launch the webphone by opening the webphone.htm file locally in your browser, or integrate it with your website (for example just add it in a frame)

*You need at least the Standard license for this to work (the basic version doesn't contain the java script API)
*This is just an example skin (but fully working and tested). We are not specialized on web frontend development. You might be able to write better html/js/css code
