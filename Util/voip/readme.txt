About
-----
The Mizu websipphone (webphone) allows you to initiate and accept VoIP (SIP) calls from browsers without the need of any intermediary server. Will connect to your VoIP server directly as desktop phones does.

Files in this package
---------------------
-webphone.jar: the product itself
-Mizu_WebSIPPhone.pdf and Mizu_WebSIPPhone.chm: help files (pdf and windows help formats)
-readme.txt: this file
-license_agrement.txt: you must accept the SLA before to use the websipphone
-mediaench directory: optional files for media enchnagements that might be used by the websipphone 
-the rest of the files: are usage examples


How to run a quick test?
------------------------
You can launch the websipphone from your local file system for tests. It is working in the same way as it will do when you copy it on your web server.

Do not open the webphone.jar directly. Open an html example file instead (which will load the .jar file). 
You must place the html file and the .jar file in the same directory (this can also modified by the applet parameter but these example html files will not work if the webphone.jar is not found in the same directory.

To make the websipphone usable you must set at least the "serveraddress" applet parameter in the html file. (set to your VoIP server domain name or IP address)
