To achieve better OCR results it is strongly suggested to 
create custom template file for each font phpOCR is used.

1) Create image with numbers 0 to 9 like in file 0-9.phg
2) Open phpOCR index.php in web browser
3) Chose file and select output type- "template"
4) Click "Parse"
5) Save result in file and replace char_inc_6.php
6) DONE. Ready to try the new template :)
