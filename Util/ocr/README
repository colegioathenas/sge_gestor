phpOCR v0.03 - the php Optical Character Recognizer
                       http://sourceforge.net/projects/phpocr/


phpOCR is a simple optical character recognizer. It is very alpha so 
consider that when you use it.

INSTALLATION:

1) for phpOCR-0.0.3.tar.bz2 do: bzcat phpOCR-0.0.3.tar.bz2 |tar xv
   for phpOCR-0.0.3.tar.gz do: zcat phpOCR-0.0.3.tar.gz |tar xv
2) copy char_inc_6.php, index.php and tmp1.png to folder where webserver can find them

For simple tryout that should be all.
Have fun.


NOTES:

*)If you want to use gif images you need to have programm gif2png under /usr/local/bin.
Some file permission shanges should also be necessary. Check index.php for more info.

*)It is possible to use phpOCR in automated scripts.
	a)One way is to use curl or wget or similar utility and do something like:
	curl -s -o out1.txt http://YOUR_URL/index.php?out=plain&filename=http://REMOTE_URL/image.png

	b)The better way would be to edit index.php and change it to suit your needs. The index.php 
	should be pretty much self explanatory.

*)To get the best quality and speed recognition out of particular font is to create a font file. 
	a)create image that has all digits from 0 to 9 in that order in one line. 
	b)In "output type" chose "template" and upload.
	c)Copy output code and create a new char_inc_*.php.
	d)In index.php find line that contains
		$conf['font_file'] = 'char_inc_6.php';
	  and replace 'char_inc_6.php' with your newly generated font file.
